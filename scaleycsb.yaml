  # workload
  # YCSB workload.  Valid values are a-f. Each letter determines a different
  # mix of read and update workload percentage generated. a= 50/50, b=95/5,
  # c=100 read. Refer to YCSB documentation for more detail
  workload: b

  # noOfProcesses
  # Number of YCSB processes. Number of concurrent YCSB processes that will
  # be started in each YCSB pod. Each YCSB process makes a connection to the
  # database.
  noOfProcesses: 2

  # noOfRows: 10000
  # YCSB number of initial rows in table
  noOfRows: 100000

  # opsPerIteration
  # Number of YCSB SQL operations to perform in each iteration.
  # This value controls the number of SQL operations performed in each benchmark
  # iteration. Increasing this value increases the run-time of each iteration,
  # and also reduces the frequency at which new connections are made during the
  # sample workload run period.
  opsPerIteration: 100000
